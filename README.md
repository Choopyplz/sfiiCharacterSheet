# sfiiCharacterSheet

<h1>Purpose</h1>
The purpose of this page is to provide users with detailed knowledge about each usable character in the classic arcade game Street Fighter II Super Turbo.

<h2>Basic Features</h2>
The splash page will have a grid of character portraits from the game that when selected, displays a bio page underneath the character select grid that has detailed info about each character. The data (uncluding any media such as video clips or sound) will be recalled using MongoDB. 

The bottom of the page will have a poll that asks which character is the user's favorite, and the collective data will be displayed in a visualization at the bottom of the page, likely in the form of a graph.
